# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Purpose & Scope**: Plan delivers only AR-HUD v1 supported capabilities (phone camera AR, ground plane detection, stable reticle, distance and layup markers, target line, qualitative wind hint, CaddieCore v1 club suggestion, sunlight-readable theme, tap/long-press/swipe gestures, offline continuity within the current hole) and explicitly defers out-of-scope features (multi-golfer sync, AR glasses, night mode, lidar elevation, live ball-flight tracking, 3D green contours, voice control, social overlays, live scoring).
- **Performance & Latency**: Work sustains camera preview >=30 fps (target 45), HUD update latency <=120 ms, pose jitter <1.0 deg RMS over 3 seconds, world drift <0.5 m over 30 seconds at 1.2 m/s, thermal logging proves 15-minute sessions without shutdown, cold start <=3.0 s, and battery impact <=9% per 15-minute session at 75% brightness.
- **Accuracy & Anchoring**: Design keeps distance overlays within 2.0 m for 30-200 m ranges, preserves 95% anchor persistence within 0.5 m after 30 seconds slow pan, and keeps wind hints qualitative only.
- **Reliability & Fallbacks**: Plan maintains >=99.5% crash-free sessions across the trailing 1,000 runs, enforces downgrade to 2D compass view when tracking is poor >2 s with auto-recovery, and keeps offline continuity plus offline badge behaviour intact.
- **UX & Accessibility**: HUD maintains WCAG AA contrast at 75% brightness, single-handed reach on 6.7 inch screens, font scaling to 130% without layout breakage, a clear center 8% FOV, and the periodic "Heads up" safety prompt.
- **Security & Privacy**: Frames and location stay on-device unless consent is granted, telemetry is anonymized without raw frames/PII, and permissions are requested only when needed.
- **Observability & Telemetry**: Plan captures metrics (session_count, session_duration, fps_avg, fps_p10, latency_ms_p50/p90, tracking_quality_p50, anchor_resets, thermal_warnings, fallback_events), structured JSON logs (build_id, device_class), and ensures detailed perf traces sample <=10% sessions.
- **Quality Gates**: Implementation enforces >=85% line coverage, lint with zero errors and <=5 warnings, bundle growth <=20 MB per platform, deterministic builds via pinned toolchains, and a maintained license manifest with no GPL-only dependencies.
- **Testing Strategy**: Tasks cover unit tests for transforms/projection/distance math, simulation suites for synthetic camera paths and drift/latency cases, device runs on 2 Android + 2 iOS reference devices, field validation (tee, fairway, approach) with all SLOs passing, and golden screenshots for main HUD states at three font scales.
- **Interoperability**: Calls to CaddieCore v1 remain read-only with 200 ms timeouts and graceful degradation, and feature flags (`hud_wind_hint`, `hud_target_line`, `hud_battery_saver`) control optional experiences.
- **Developer Experience**: Output keeps `make run-ios` and `make run-android` launching the demo hole, bundles offline example hole data, and retains the three-finger tap performance overlay.
- **Release Criteria**: Plan records artifacts for SLO/accuracy compliance, zero open P0/P1 issues, PM and QA field checklist sign-off, and completed privacy review with telemetry sampling checks.
- **Terminology & Clarity**: Deliverables use the shared definitions for HUD, anchors, and drift, documenting any additions or exceptions.

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)

```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType codex`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
