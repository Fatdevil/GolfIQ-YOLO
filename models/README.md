# Models Artifacts

The files in this directory are generated by the lightweight edge export harness.

To refresh the report locally run:

```bash
python scripts/export_models.py --output-dir exports/dev --report models/EXPORT_REPORT.md --dry-run
```

The command validates the conversion pipeline without keeping binary artifacts on disk.
