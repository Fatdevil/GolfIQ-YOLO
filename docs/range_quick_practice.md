# Range Quick Practice

Quick Practice is our lightweight range flow: pick a club (optional), choose your camera angle, run through setup, and log a bucket with automatic shot analysis. Summaries are stored locally so players can resume quickly and review their last outing.

## Home card

- The GolfIQ Play home screen now surfaces a **Range & Training** card with a single tap entry to Quick Practice.
- The card previews the latest range session using the cached `golfiq.range.lastSession.v1` summary (club + shot count when available).
- When no history exists, it shows a friendly empty state encouraging players to start a Quick Practice.
- A tiny teaser reminds users that planned missions are coming soon.
