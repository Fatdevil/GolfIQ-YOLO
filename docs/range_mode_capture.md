# Range Mode Capture Guide

Range Mode is optimized for reliable ball tracking on mobile cameras. Follow this guide to standardize capture conditions and reduce tracking errors.

## Camera placement
- **Behind the player (recommended):** 10–15 ft (3–5 m) behind the golfer, centered on the target line.
- **Side view (acceptable):** 8–12 ft (2.5–3.5 m) off the player’s lead side, aimed at the hitting area.
- **Height:** Keep the lens at waist-to-chest height to keep the ball flight and club path in frame.
- **Framing:** Include the ball, club, and a few yards of initial flight.

## Lighting guidance
- Favor bright, even lighting (outdoor range or well-lit indoor bay).
- Avoid backlighting or direct sun into the lens.
- If indoors, point lighting toward the hitting area and avoid flicker.

## Background guidance
- Use a clean background with minimal movement.
- Avoid busy nets, crowds, or rapidly moving objects behind the ball.

## Recommended capture settings
- **FPS:** 120+ recommended (60 minimum).
- **Resolution:** 1080p+ recommended (720 minimum).
- **Stabilization:** Use a tripod whenever possible.

## Quick checklist (5–7 items)
1. Phone is stable on a tripod or solid surface.
2. 120+ FPS enabled (slow-motion mode).
3. 1080p resolution selected.
4. Bright, even lighting on the hitting area.
5. Clean background with minimal motion.
6. Ball and club stay in frame through impact.
7. Camera is aligned with the target line.

## Guardrails → Tips mapping
- **LOW_FPS** → Enable slow-motion mode or increase FPS.
- **LOW_RESOLUTION** → Increase resolution to 1080p or higher.
- **UNDEREXPOSED** → Improve lighting or move to a brighter area.
- **OVEREXPOSED** → Avoid harsh direct light; reduce exposure.
- **MOTION_BLUR** → Use a faster shutter or stabilize the camera.
- **CAMERA_SHAKE** → Use a tripod or stabilize the phone.
