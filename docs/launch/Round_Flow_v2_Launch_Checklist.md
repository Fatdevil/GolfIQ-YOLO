# Round Flow v2 Launch Checklist

Use this checklist when toggling `roundFlowV2` via the remote rollout:

- **Flag ON**: new flow start/resume/end works without errors.
- **Flag OFF**: legacy round flow remains unchanged.
- Resume active round works from Home/Resume entry points.
- Finish → recap renders and analytics fire.
- Round analytics events fire for both flag states.
