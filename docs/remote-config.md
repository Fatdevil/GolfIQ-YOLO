# Remote Config (Device Tier Feature Flags)

The remote configuration endpoint exposes lightweight JSON feature overrides for
mobile clients. Configuration is stored in-memory inside the API process and is
primarily intended for internal experimentation across device performance tiers
(A/B/C).

## Endpoint Overview

| Method | Path              | Description                               |
| ------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/config/remote`  | Fetch the current configuration snapshot. |
| POST   | `/config/remote`  | Replace the configuration (admin only).   |

### Default Payload

```json
{
  "tierA": {
    "hudEnabled": true,
    "inputSize": 320,
    "analyticsEnabled": false,
    "crashEnabled": false
  },
  "tierB": {
    "hudEnabled": true,
    "inputSize": 320,
    "reducedRate": true,
    "analyticsEnabled": false,
    "crashEnabled": false
  },
  "tierC": {
    "hudEnabled": false,
    "analyticsEnabled": false,
    "crashEnabled": false
  }
}
```

### HTTP Caching

GET responses include an `ETag` header that is the SHA-256 hash of the JSON
payload. Clients should send `If-None-Match` on subsequent fetches and treat a
`304 Not Modified` response as a signal to reuse their cached configuration.

Responses are marked `Cache-Control: no-cache` to avoid intermediary caching.

### Admin Updates

`POST /config/remote` requires the `ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable to be set.
Requests must include a `X-Admin-Token` header matching the configured value and
originate from the same origin as the API host (simple localhost safeguard).
The payload must contain `tierA`, `tierB`, and `tierC` objects.

Successful updates echo the stored configuration and the fresh `ETag`.

## Client Usage Pattern

1. Fetch on app start (with `If-None-Match` if a cached `ETag` exists).
2. When a new configuration is returned, select the tier-specific overrides and
   merge them with the device defaults.
3. Apply overrides for:
   - `hudEnabled`
   - `inputSize`
   - `reducedRate`
   - `analyticsEnabled`
   - `crashEnabled`
4. Log the active `ETag` (or hash) through telemetry for observability.
5. Refresh periodically (clients poll every 12 hours).

Clients are resilient to partial payloadsâ€”unknown keys are ignored, and missing
keys fall back to defaults computed from the device tier.
