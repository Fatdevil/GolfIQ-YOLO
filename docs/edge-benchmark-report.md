# Edge Benchmark Report Harness

This repository includes a lightweight export harness that generates a tiny ONNX model and benchmarks it on CPU. For every pull request touching the harness, CI uploads the generated report and model artifact for inspection.

The latest run artifacts are attached to the PR under the `edge-bench-report` bundle.
