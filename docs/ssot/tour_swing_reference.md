# Tour swing reference (v1)

This file documents the heuristic reference bands captured in [`tour_swing_reference.json`](./tour_swing_reference.json).

## Covered metrics
- `max_shoulder_rotation`
- `max_hip_rotation`
- `max_x_factor`
- `launch_deg` (driver and 7i windows)

Bands are grouped by player cohort (e.g., `tour_male`, `amateur_15_25`) and optionally scoped per club (`driver`, `7i`). They are intended for quick “you vs tour” comparisons and can be refined as more data is collected.
